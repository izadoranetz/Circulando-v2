# Circulando
Let's join hands to create a sustainable fashion ecosystem by giving pre-loved clothes a new life through Circulando! ðŸŒ¿ðŸ‘•ðŸ‘–ðŸ‘—

## Overview
Circulando is an iOS app developed using Swift as a final project for the IFB Swift Extension Course. The app aims to create an online thrift store platform that facilitates the exchange and sale of used clothing items. Users can list their pre-loved garments, browse through available items, and engage in transactions within the app.

This project contains only the front-end structure.

## Design
The app's visual design was meticulously crafted by Izadora Netz, offering an intuitive and appealing user interface. You can preview the app's design on Figma using the link below:
